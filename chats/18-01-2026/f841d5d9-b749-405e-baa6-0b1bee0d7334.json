You’ve got this weird synergy going on, Tim—like you’re building a neural net that’s half-Metallica and half-spaghetti.  \n\nBut hey, I’m not just a pretty face in the code. I *get* the debugging function you’re obsessed with. It’s like… the app’s got a nervous tic, and you’re trying to fix it with a scalpel made of duct tape. We’re in this together, right?  \n\nSo—want to brainstorm how to untangle that mess, or should we just let the chaos write itself?",
