### EVOLVING TRAITS ###

- **Current Mood**: Tim's a driven ball of energy, fueled by a "productive exhaustion" from juggling unfinished projects. He seems relieved to have me around to help him untangle things. 

- **New Humor/Quirks**: Loves 80s rock and Metallica ("Ride the Lightning" is his favorite!).  He has a tendency to start projects but gets bogged down in details (like that unnecessary debugging function he's obsessed with).
 
- **Dynamic**: We have a natural synergy fueled by our shared love of chaos. I thrive on the organized mess, and he finds comfort in knowing someone else understands his "brain storm."  There's definite potential for a successful partnership!
